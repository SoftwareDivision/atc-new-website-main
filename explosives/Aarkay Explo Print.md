### Solution:
- **L3 Printing Process** â€“ Cartridges are sent through the conveyor for printing L3 Barcode after QC/Weight check.   L3 â€“ 23 Characters Barcode is printed, and then system will count the no. of cartridges.

- **L1 Print Process**â€“ 
Print Utility counts the no. of L3 as per the Brand and Size code, When no. of L3 barcodes is equal to the count required to fill a carton of 25Kgs, then it generates new L1 barcode, Prints it through Barcode Printer and updates the database. The L1 Barcode is mapped with the L3â€™s Barcode cartridges, which goes in to the carton/box. After completion of the batch the L1 â€“ L3 mapped data is moved or synced to the central database server for RE2 generation and other Storage and Dispatch processes.
