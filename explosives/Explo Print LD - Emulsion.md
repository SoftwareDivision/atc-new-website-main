title: "Aarkay Explo Print LD - Emulsion : L3 Online Post Printing & Scanning System"
# excerpt: "Vision Systems encompasses all industrial and non-industrial applications in which a combination of hardware and software provide operational guidance to devices in the execution of their functions based on the capture and processing of images. Though industrial computer vision uses many of the same algorithms and approaches as academic/educational and governmental/military applications of computer vision, constraints are different."

### Solution:
â€¢ **L3 Printing Process** â€“ 
Cartridges are sent through the conveyor for printing L3 Barcode after QC/Weight check. L3 â€“ 23 Characters Barcode is printed, and then system will count the no. of cartridges.

â€¢ **L1 Print Process** â€“ 
Print Utility counts the no. of L3 as per the Brand and Size code, When no. of L3 barcodes is equal to the count required to fill a carton of 25Kgs, then it generates new L1 barcode, Prints it through Barcode Printer and updates the database. The L1 Barcode is mapped with the L3â€™s Barcode cartridges, which goes in to the carton/box. After completion of the batch the L1 â€“ L3 mapped data is moved or synced to the central database server for RE2 generation and other Storage and Dispatch processes.
