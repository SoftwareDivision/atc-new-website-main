# excerpt: "Vision Systems encompasses all industrial and non-industrial applications in which a combination of hardware and software provide operational guidance to devices in the execution of their functions based on the capture and processing of images. Though industrial computer vision uses many of the same algorithms and approaches as academic/educational and governmental/military applications of computer vision, constraints are different."

### Solutions:

â€¢ **L3 Printing Process** â€“ 
Cartridges are sent through the conveyor for printing L3 Barcode after QC. L3 â€“ 23 Characters Barcode is printed, and then system scans the barcode printed on the cartridge. If the Scanner reads the barcode, it gets transferred to the database and fill in the carton, if it not readable then it will reject the Cartridge. The system will keep a count depending on brand Id and Size Code and as soon as count of Cartridge per Carton is reached the system will divert the next cartridge to other carton for filling. Speed of Post Printing and Scanning Final SD Cartridges.

â€¢ **L1 Print Process and Mapping of L3** â€“ 
Offline Pre-Printing of L1 Carton Sticker will be done and it will pasted before filling the cartons, and the system counts the no. of L3 as per the Brand and Size code, When no. of L3 barcodes is equal to the count required to fill a carton of 25Kgs or as per std., and records the L3 unique nos. against L1 and updates the database. L1 Barcode is mapped with the L3â€™s Barcode cartridges which goes in to the carton/box. After completion of the batch the L1 â€“ L3 mapped data is moved or synced to the central database server for RE2 generation and other Storage and Dispatch processes.
It streamlines production while reducing downtime and training efforts, making it an **efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly solution** for the explosives sector.
